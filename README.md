This repository contains small projects that I created for Introduction to artifitial inteligenc classes at Warsaw University of Technology. A lot of explenations, and data analizis is in polish because it was the language in which the classes were conducted. All of the code is in english (because that is the standard) so it shouldn't be really hard to understand it.

All of the projects used .ipynb files that allowed for quick development and incorporation of into the code. Most of the projects were creadted with the use of google collab platform so if you want to test the code I sugest you download the filae and upload it to your google collab. Only project that didn't use project was the minmax algorithm. It used custom repo from GitHub, because of that it'easier to just dowloadd repo localy. I created .gitmodules file to allow easier download of the repo.
