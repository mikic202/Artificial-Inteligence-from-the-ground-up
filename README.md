This repository contains small projects that I created for the Introduction to artificial intelligence course at Warsaw University of Technology. A lot of explanations and data analysis are in Polish because it was the language in which the course was conducted. All of the code is in English (because that is the standard), so it shouldn't be really hard to understand it.

All of the projects used .ipynb files that allowed for quick development and incorporation of comments and data analisis into the code. Most of the projects were created with the use of the Google Collab platform, so if you want to test the code, I suggest you download the file and upload it to your Google Collab. The only project that didn't use project was the minimax algorithm. It used a custom repo from GitHub, and because of that, it's easier to just download the repo locally. I created .gitmodules file to allow easier download of the repo.
